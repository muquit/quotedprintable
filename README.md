## Introduction

Package quotedprintable implements quoted-printable and message header encoding
as specified by RFC 2045 and RFC 2047.

It is a copy of the Go 1.5 package `mime/quotedprintable`. It also includes
the new functions of package `mime` concerning RFC 2047.

This code has minor changes with the standard library code in order to work
with Go 1.0 and newer.
